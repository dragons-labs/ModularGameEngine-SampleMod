	<!-- This file is also read when a different map is loaded, so can be used to override settings from other mod or default game.
	     To do this must define resource group with the same name as used in map from other mod or default game with doInit="false" attribute.
	     And define new (additional) resource path containing files with the same name as in other mod or default game. For example:
	
	<Group doInit="false" name="ActionsConfig">
		<Entry type="dir" recursionMode="asFiles" path="resources/SampleMod/Actions" />
	</Group>
	
	     It's possible override only some XML configs (as actors, actions, world map).
	     Override for this config is based on priority attribute in its root node. For example:
	     Action define from file "aaa.xml" in group "BBB" with root node:
	          <Actions priority="15">
	     will be override by other file "aaa.xml" in group "BBB" with root node:
	          <Actions priority="25">
	     but will NOT be override by file "aaa.xml" in group "BBB" with root node:
	          <Actions priority="5">
	     nor by any file with not matching name or group name.
	     Override other resources (e.g. meshesh, textures) could not work (win last loaded path).
